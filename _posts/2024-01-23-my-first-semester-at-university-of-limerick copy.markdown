**Orientation Week**

In the week before the semester started, there was a lot going on: Orientation, Treasure Hunt, even the fire show! Thanks to these awesome events, I had the luck to meet some very interesting people, whom I've befriended. I also visited the city, although our campus is way nicer.

**Fresher's  Week**

After checking out the gym and the swimming pool, I decided I want to take advantage of UL's amazing sport facilities. That's why I joined the volleyball and badminton club. Unfortunately, there's currently no tennis club on the UL Wolves website.

**Midterms**

Since I enjoyed every lecture of every module, I knew I was ready for the exams. It was much more interesting than high school lectures. I could actually understand why I'm learning what I'm learning, and that made it so much easier to keep me interested. With that, I knew I can achieve a good score.

| SUBJECT | RESULT |
| ------ | ---------- |
| INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING | 100% |
| DISCRETE MATHEMATICS | 100% |
| FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER ORGANISATION | 100% |
| FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE | 99% |

**Final Exams**

While dealing with such tasks as acquiring my PPS number, applying for the SUSI grant, and getting Chrismas gifts, the time had come for me to prepare for the final exams. Drawing from my experince with midterms, I knew what to expect. Here's how it went.  

| SUBJECT | GRADE |
| ------ | ---------- |
| INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING | A1 |
| DISCRETE MATHEMATICS | A1 |
| FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER ORGANISATION | A1 |
| FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE | A1 |
| REPRESENTATION AND MODELLING | A1 |

Note: swimming in the evening is the perfect way to clear the mind and relax.
