**Back in Ireland [ACTIVE]**

After beautiful holidays with my family and friends, attending The Kellner Family Foundation scholars' meeting, I returned to Ireland. Even during the holidays, I dedicated time to improving my coding skills and preparing for the second semester. I expanded my coding portfolio and gained insights into implementing Java interfaces for GUIs. Furthermore, I am working towards establishing a tennis club as I believe it would be a great tribute to the University of Limerick.
