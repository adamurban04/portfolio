**Orientation Week**

In the week before the semester started, there was a lot going on. Orientation, Treasure Hunt, even the fire show! Thanks to these awesome events I had the luck to meet some very interesting people, whom I've befriended. I've also visited the city, although our campus is way nicer.

**Fresher's  Week**

After checking out the gym and the swimming pool, I have decided I want to use the opportunity of UL's amazing sport facilities. That's why I have joined the volleyball and badminton club. Unlucky for me, there's currently no tennis club at the UL Wolves website.

**Midterms**

Since I have enjoyed every lecture of every module, I knew I was ready for the exams. It was much more interesting to me compared to high school lectures. I could actually understand why I'm learning what I'm learning and that made it so much easier to keep me interested. With that, I knew I can achieve a good score and so I did.
